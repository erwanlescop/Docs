# PageLines Sections #

PageLines DMS Sections are modular extensions based on the PageLines Drag & Drop architecture, and are included in the core DMS. If you are looking for information on configuring or activating sections, please review [this guide](http://docs.pagelines.com/configure/configuring-sections).

## Columnizer ##

When you first add Columnizer to your template, you will see the following default content. This information is provided for demonstration purposes and can be replaced by simply adding widgets to a sidebar that has been assigned to Columnizer.

## Comments ##

Comments are a way for visitors to add feedback to your posts and pages. The Comment Section controls where your comments are displayed. Removing the comments section from any of your templates, will disable comments from this template.
